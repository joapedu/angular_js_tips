## üîß First Project
- First of all, we have to install the Angular CLI with:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

- Now, it made it possible to create projects more easily, just using:

```bash
ng new <name>
```

- To test the project just type the command:

```bash
ng serve
```

- Lastly, modifications should only be made to the **app** folder, to reflect browser changes.
